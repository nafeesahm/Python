""" Encapsulation """

"""the process of binding / grouping / encapsulating data and corresponding bahaviour(Method) into to a single unit"""

""" Every python class is an example of encapsulation"""


"""in reality Example: """
# if any component follows data hiding and abstraction , such component is said to be encapsulated component..
# Encapsulation = data hiding + abstraction


"""Hiding data behind method  is central concept of encapsulation"""

"""Advantage: 
            1. Security
            2. Enhancement will become very easy
            3. Maintanability and Modularity
            """

"""what problem is there : 
it increases length of the code because validation required for every operation,  
so , very slow execution , so performance go down

"""
# if you don't want security  , don't use Encapsulation
